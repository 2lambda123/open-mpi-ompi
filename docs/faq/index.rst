Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

.. error:: This section represents old content from the <= v4.x FAQ
           that has not been properly converted to the new-style
           documentation.  The content here was perfunctorily
           converted to RST, but it still needs to be:

           #. Converted from a question-and-answer style to a regular
              documentation style (like the rest of these docs).
           #. Removed from this section and folded into other sections
              in these docs.

           To be clear, this section will eventually be deleted; do
           not write any new content in this section.

The pages below include questions that we are asked frequently enough
that they are worth categorizing in an official way.
